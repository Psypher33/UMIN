# UMIN  
## Univalent Manifold Infinity Network

**UMIN — where spacetime emerges from univalent higher identifications, not assumed as background.**

*A constructive, translational approach to quantum gravity — formally implemented and verified in Cubical Agda.*

---

## Motivation

Most current quantum gravity programs still secretly rely on:

- a **pre-existing classical spacetime background**
- **classical (non-constructive) logic**
- **externally declared isomorphisms** between distinct formalisms

UMIN rejects these assumptions at the foundational level.

Instead, it asks:

> What if spacetime, causality, and physical constants are *constructed*,  
> rather than assumed?

## Core Ideas

- **Univalence** — equivalence is internal to the theory, not imposed from outside  
- **Constructivity** — existence is given by explicit construction  
- **Manifold as Emergent** — geometry arises from higher identifications  
- **Infinity** — higher-dimensional structure is essential, not auxiliary  
- **Network** — unification is achieved by translation, not reduction  
- **Revelation / Observation** — measurement is modeled as a *revelation process*  
  *(gradual constructive disclosure of information)*

## Repository Structure and Entry Points

**Interested in the details?**  
Start with the conceptual overview in `papers/UMIN_Overview/main.tex`,  
or explore the formal Cubical Agda sources directly in the repository root.

### Agda Core

The Cubical Agda code provides:

- univalent logical foundations
- causal and order-theoretic structures
- revelation and observation formalisms
- simulation-level unification protocols

These are **proof-relevant implementations**, not pseudocode.

### Papers

The `papers/` directory contains LaTeX sources intended to *mirror* the conceptual and structural layers of the Agda implementation.

---

## Mathematical Framework

Built primarily on:

- Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT)
- Cubical Type Theory
- Constructive logic
- Category theory and ∞-groupoid semantics  
  *(∞-groupoids / higher groupoids)*

The Agda code serves as a **semantic backbone** for the entire framework.

## Status

- Core logical axioms and type-theoretic foundations: implemented  
- Univalence-related structures: partially verified in path spaces  
- Causal order and revelation primitives: constructed  
- Simulations: exploratory toy models  

### Ongoing / Planned

- Synthetic translation functors between emergent scales  
- Cosmological toy models (de Sitter / FLRW-like boundaries)  
- Semi-classical phenomenological signatures  
- Integration with broader **UMIN_Infinity** structure

---

## Philosophy

UMIN explicitly incorporates **epistemic humility**.

The framework is designed to acknowledge:

- limits of observation  
- dependence on constructive context  
- non-closure of theoretical frameworks  

This is not a weakness, but a deliberate structural principle.
